# linked-lists-problems
Pointer algorithms in C for common Linked Lists problems.

The problems use the C language syntax, so they require a basic understanding of C and
its pointer syntax. The emphasis is on the important concepts of pointer manipulation and
linked list algorithms rather than the features of the C language.

A base class - linkedlist.c, with basic utitlity functions, is defined in [/extensions]/extensions.
